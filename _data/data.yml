        "Thesis Project: RGB Video‑Based Hand Action Quality
        Assessment in Real Time and
        VR‑Enabled Gesture Control of Robotic Arm"
      time: July 2019 ‑ Dec. 2019
      company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
      details: |
          - Applied LSTM to the key points extraction to reach 82% accuracy on hand pose estimation
          - Designed and implemented algorithm on detecting and distinguishing hand states
          - Used OpenPose to detect human arm and hand and transferred the key points info to robotic arm and VR
          - Implemented TCP and UDP socket communication between server and rk3399 microprocessor
          - Used Robot Operating System (ROS) in rk3399 to control robotic arm
          - Awarded silver award in Capstone Design Expo of UM‑SJTU Joint Institute
    - title: "Undergraduate Innovative Research Project: A Fusion of Radio Frequency (RF) and Computer Vision (CV) System for Enhanced Indoor Localization"
      time: Mar. 2019 ‑ Feb. 2020
      company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
      details: |
          - Innovatively adopted the approach of combining radio frequency with computer vision to make up for the lack of RF positioning accuracy and CV camera flexibility
          - Used wirelessInsite and USRP to collect RF data in simulated and real environments
          - Combined methods of KNN and random forest with computer vision feedback, and improve the coarse RF grid positioning accuracy to 100%
          - Designed a CV positioning algorithm to approximate the accuracy of traditional CV positioning under the circumstance of without using visual calibration to increase the flexibility of the camera
    - title: "Wireless Communication & AI Laboratory Project: Distributed Machine Learning"
      time: Mar. 2018 ‑ Dev. 2019
      company: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
      details: |
          - Studied papers related to distributed machine learning especially K‑batch Asynchronous Gradient Descent (ASGD)
          - Built and tested distributed tensorflow using several Raspberry Pis
          - Built a distributed machine learning system using socket communication with one PC as parameter server and multiple Raspberry Pis as worker to facilitate subsequent testing
          - Conducted theoretical calculations on some new optimization methods for k‑batch ASGD
